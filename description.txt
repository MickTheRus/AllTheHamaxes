Have you ever been annoyed by your Axe and Hammer taking up 2 slots in your precious inventory and Only having a Meteor and Molten Hamaxes? Now you don't need to worry about this!!! All The Hamaxes solves that solution by giving tier 1-4 ores a hamaxe with exact power of the respectable hammer and axe.

v0.1: I was BORN! But seriously mod released with 8 hamaxes for tier 1-4 ores. 

v0.2: Updated build.txt and some other things, don't remember.

v0.3: Bone hamaxe added with drop rate of 0.49% from Skeletons, also 5% from Undead Miners just..... For No Reason...
