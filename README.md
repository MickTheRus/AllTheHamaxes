Have you ever been annoyed by your Axe and Hammer taking up 2 slots in your precious inventory and Only having a Meteor and Molten Hamaxes? Now you don't need to worry about this!!! 
All The Hamaxes solves that solution by giving tier 1-4 ores a hamaxe with exact power of the respectable hammer and axe.

This is just my first mod, was practicing for making a better mod and learning how things work lol.
